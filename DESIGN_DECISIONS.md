### Flask Framework Selection
**Decision**: Built the application using Flask rather than alternatives like Django or FastAPI.

**Rationale**:
- Lightweight and minimalist approach matches research tool requirements
- Flexibility for asynchronous processing without excessive boilerplate
- Easy integration with various Python libraries
- Simple deployment options including containerization

**Trade-offs**:
- Less built-in structure compared to Django
- Fewer automatic optimizations compared to FastAPI

### In-Memory Session Management
**Decision**: Used in-memory session storage for conversation history.

**Rationale**:
- Simpler implementation without database dependencies
- Sufficient for prototype and demonstration purposes
- Avoids privacy concerns of persistent user data storage
- Faster access to session data during research

**Trade-offs**:
- Limited session persistence (cleared on server restart)
- Not suitable for high-availability multi-server deployments without modification
- Limited history retention (capped at 10 sessions)

## Research Process Design

### Modular Tool-Based Approach
**Decision**: Implemented research as a series of specialized tools rather than a monolithic process.

**Rationale**:
- Enables better separation of concerns
- Facilitates targeted testing of individual components
- Allows for easier future extensions with new tools
- Provides flexibility to swap implementations (e.g., different search providers)

**Trade-offs**:
- Requires more coordination between components
- Can introduce overhead in data passing between tools

### Sequential Processing with Progress Updates
**Decision**: Process research steps sequentially with real-time progress updates rather than waiting for complete results.

**Rationale**:
- Provides immediate feedback to users
- Reduces perceived waiting time for research completion
- Allows users to start reading early findings while remaining sources are processed
- Creates a more engaging and dynamic user experience

**Trade-offs**:
- More complex state management
- Requires careful error handling for each processing stage

## AI Integration Choices

### Google Gemini API
**Decision**: Selected Google's Gemini API for AI capabilities rather than alternatives like OpenAI's GPT or Anthropic's Claude.

**Rationale**:
- Excellent performance for research-oriented tasks
- Strong capabilities in factual analysis
- Competitive pricing model for production use
- Good documentation and reliability

**Trade-offs**:
- API-specific implementation details
- Dependency on a single AI provider

### Query Optimization Strategy
**Decision**: Added a dedicated query analysis step before web search.

**Rationale**:
- Improves search effectiveness by refining ambiguous queries
- Identifies key concepts and relationships in complex questions
- Generates better search terms for more relevant results
- Reduces the number of irrelevant sources that need processing

**Trade-offs**:
- Adds latency before search begins
- Consumes additional AI tokens

## Search and Content Processing

### DuckDuckGo Search API
**Decision**: Used DuckDuckGo Search API rather than alternatives like Google Custom Search.

**Rationale**:
- No daily query limits for development and testing
- Fewer restrictions on automated use
- Good coverage of web content
- Simpler authentication requirements

**Trade-offs**:
- Sometimes less comprehensive than Google Search
- May have different ranking algorithms affecting result quality

### Parallel vs. Sequential Source Processing
**Decision**: Process sources sequentially rather than in parallel.

**Rationale**:
- Simpler implementation without threading/async complexity
- Enables clearer progress tracking for users
- Reduces risk of API rate limiting
- Allows for adaptive processing based on initial results

**Trade-offs**:
- Potentially longer total processing time
- Less efficient use of available compute resources

### Content Extraction Approach
**Decision**: Use BeautifulSoup with custom extraction logic rather than specialized extractors.

**Rationale**:
- Flexibility to handle diverse web page structures
- No additional dependencies or services required
- Direct control over extraction quality and customization
- Lightweight implementation suitable for containerized deployment

**Trade-offs**:
- May struggle with heavily JavaScript-rendered content
- Requires maintenance as web standards evolve

## Context-Awareness Implementation

### Session-Based Context
**Decision**: Implemented context awareness at the session level rather than user accounts.

**Rationale**:
- Avoids need for user authentication system
- Simpler privacy model with ephemeral data
- Sufficient for demonstrating context-aware capabilities
- Allows for easy context clearing

**Trade-offs**:
- Context lost if user clears cookies or switches browsers
- No long-term learning across multiple research sessions

### Limited History Retention
**Decision**: Limit history to 10 most recent research sessions.

**Rationale**:
- Balances memory usage with contextual benefits
- Focuses on recent and likely relevant context
- Manageable context window for AI processing
- Prevents context overload in long sessions

**Trade-offs**:
- May lose potentially relevant older context
- Fixed limit rather than adaptive based on relevance

## Deployment Strategy

### Docker Containerization
**Decision**: Package the application as a Docker container.

**Rationale**:
- Consistent environment across development and production
- Simplified deployment to various cloud platforms
- Isolated dependencies and runtime
- Better resource control and scaling options

**Trade-offs**:
- Additional complexity compared to direct deployment
- Slightly higher resource overhead

### Environment Variable Configuration
**Decision**: Use environment variables for all configuration rather than config files.

**Rationale**:
- Standard approach for containerized applications
- Supports the 12-factor app methodology
- Easier integration with CI/CD pipelines and cloud platforms
- Separates code from configuration

**Trade-offs**:
- Less structure compared to typed configuration objects
- Requires documentation of available environment variables

## Testing Approach

### Focus on Component Testing
**Decision**: Emphasize testing of individual components rather than end-to-end tests.

**Rationale**:
- Better isolation of failure points
- Faster test execution
- Less susceptibility to external service availability
- More targeted bug identification

**Trade-offs**:
- May miss integration issues between components
- Requires careful test boundary definitions

### Mock-Based Testing for External Services
**Decision**: Use mocks for external services (search, AI) in tests.

**Rationale**:
- Avoids dependency on external service availability
- Prevents unnecessary API costs during testing
- Enables testing of edge cases and error conditions
- Faster test execution

**Trade-offs**:
- Mocks may not perfectly represent actual service behavior
- Requires maintenance when external APIs change
